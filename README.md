## ☁️ 100 Days of Azure Cloud Challenge
## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my 100 Days of Azure Cloud Challenge, a hands-on learning journey focused on building real-world cloud infrastructure skills using Microsoft Azure.

Each day covers a practical Azure task related to compute, networking, storage, security, containers, and application services. All work is documented with clear explanations and visual proof to demonstrate real Azure experience.

This repository is maintained as a public Azure cloud portfolio for recruiters, hiring managers, and cloud engineers.

## 🎯 Objectives

  - Build strong fundamentals in Microsoft Azure
  - Gain hands-on experience with Azure Virtual Machines, networking, storage, and security
  - Understand how Azure resources are created, configured, and managed
  - Develop consistent documentation and proof of work
  - Prepare for real-world cloud and DevOps roles
